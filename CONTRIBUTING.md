# Contributing to AI Platform

This document outlines the development practices for our AI platform implementation.

## Branch Structure

- `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for completed features
- Feature branches: Individual components (e.g., `feature/ai-integration`)

## Development Flow

1. Create a feature branch for each component:

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/component-name
```

2. Make incremental changes with clear commit messages:

```
[component] Brief description

- Detailed explanation if needed
- Motivation for change
- Any notable impacts
```

Example:

```
[model] Add OpenAI API client

- Implement API authentication
- Add response error handling
- Update tests for API calls
```

3. Test thoroughly before merging:

- All unit tests must pass
- New features must include tests
- Document any configuration changes

## Project Structure

Keep components organized:

```
ai_platform/
├── src/
│   └── ai_platform/
│       ├── model/        # Model interface
│       ├── retrieval/    # RAG system
│       ├── guardrails/   # Safety checks
│       └── cache/        # Caching system
├── tests/
└── docs/                 # Implementation notes
```

## Progressive Implementation

Each new component should:

1. Start with a minimal working version
2. Include basic tests
3. Document key design decisions
4. Note interactions with other components
